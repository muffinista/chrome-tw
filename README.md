## What It Is

This is a Chrome Extension that you can use to hide tweets which
either start with phrases, or have a phrase somewhere in the middle.
This is handy for a couple reasons. For example:

- If you want to hide tweets that people have prefaced with
trigger/content warnings, you can use "Mask tweets that start with:"
with "cw , tw "

- If you want to hide tweets for a particular hashtag or with a
  word/etc in them (maybe for something where you don't want
  spoilers), you can "Mask tweets that contain" with a list of things
  you want to mask.


Any masked tweets will still be in your timeline, with a 'show' link
and the snippet of text that caused them to be hidden. You can click
the link to see the tweet.
